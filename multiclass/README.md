### How to initiate the multi-classification model training

#### Checking dataset paths

1. Modify `line 31` in `train.py` to reflect the base location of both TB and Pneumonia images.
The default is `Downloads folder` with Tuberculosis and Pneumonia images in `~TB` amd `~chest_xray\train` folder respectively

### Running the script

1. Open the project in the code editor
2. Change parameters if necessary in the `train.py` file.
3. Run `train.py`
